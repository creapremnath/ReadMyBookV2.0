            BOOK TO AUDIO  CONVER SION SYSTEM  
 
 
 
Abstract:  
 The Project titled " Read My Book: Empowering the Visually Impaired with Book -to-Audio 
Conversion using OCR and TTS " is an innovative application designed to assist visually impaired 
individuals by converting printed books into easily accessible audio formats. The project utilizes 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  technology to scan and extract text from physical boo ks 
and images, converting them into machine -readable digital text. This digital text is then 
processed by a Text -to-Speech (TTS)  engine, which converts the text into high -quality audio, 
allowing users to listen to the content as an audiobook.  
In addition, the application allows users to retrieve and download previously converted 
audiobooks , offering a personalized library of accessible content. With the inclusion of various 
voice accents and languages , users can select the voice that best suits their prefer ences, 
improving the overall listening experience.  
 
This project aims to provide a seamless, user -friendly platform that enhances the independence 
of visually impaired individuals, enabling them to enjoy books and educational content without 
barr iers.

Abstract:  
 The Project titled " Read My Book: Empowering the Visually Impaired with Book -to-Audio 
Conversion using OCR and TTS " is an innovative application designed to assist visually impaired 
individuals by converting printed books into easily accessible audio formats. The project utilizes 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  technology to scan and extract text from physical boo ks 
and images, converting them into machine -readable digital text. This digital text is then 
processed by a Text -to-Speech (TTS)  engine, which converts the text into high -quality audio, 
allowing users to listen to the content as an audiobook.  
In addition, the application allows users to retrieve and download previously converted 
audiobooks , offering a personalized library of accessible content. With the inclusion of various 
voice accents and languages , users can select the voice that best suits their prefer ences, 
improving the overall listening experience.  
 
This project aims to provide a seamless, user -friendly platform that enhances the independence 
of visually impaired individuals, enabling them to enjoy books and educational content without 
barr iers.

             BOOK TO AUDIO  CONVER SION SYSTEM  
 
 
 
Abstract:  
 The Project titled " Read My Book: Empowering the Visually Impaired with Book -to-Audio 
Conversion using OCR and TTS " is an innovative application designed to assist visually impaired 
individuals by converting printed books into easily accessible audio formats. The project utilizes 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  technology to scan and extract text from physical boo ks 
and images, converting them into machine -readable digital text. This digital text is then 
processed by a Text -to-Speech (TTS)  engine, which converts the text into high -quality audio, 
allowing users to listen to the content as an audiobook.  
In addition, the application allows users to retrieve and download previously converted 
audiobooks , offering a personalized library of accessible content. With the inclusion of various 
voice accents and languages , users can select the voice that best suits their prefer ences, 
improving the overall listening experience.  
 
This project aims to provide a seamless, user -friendly platform that enhances the independence 
of visually impaired individuals, enabling them to enjoy books and educational content without 
barr iers.

Abstract:  
 The Project titled " Read My Book: Empowering the Visually Impaired with Book -to-Audio 
Conversion using OCR and TTS " is an innovative application designed to assist visually impaired 
individuals by converting printed books into easily accessible audio formats. The project utilizes 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  technology to scan and extract text from physical boo ks 
and images, converting them into machine -readable digital text. This digital text is then 
processed by a Text -to-Speech (TTS)  engine, which converts the text into high -quality audio, 
allowing users to listen to the content as an audiobook.  
In addition, the application allows users to retrieve and download previously converted 
audiobooks , offering a personalized library of accessible content. With the inclusion of various 
voice accents and languages , users can select the voice that best suits their prefer ences, 
improving the overall listening experience.  
 
This project aims to provide a seamless, user -friendly platform that enhances the independence 
of visually impaired individuals, enabling them to enjoy books and educational content without 
barr iers.

Abstract:  
 The Project titled " Read My Book: Empowering the Visually Impaired with Book -to-Audio 
Conversion using OCR and TTS " is an innovative application designed to assist visually impaired 
individuals by converting printed books into easily accessible audio formats. The project utilizes 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  technology to scan and extract text from physical boo ks 
and images, converting them into machine -readable digital text. This digital text is then 
processed by a Text -to-Speech (TTS)  engine, which converts the text into high -quality audio, 
allowing users to listen to the content as an audiobook.  
In addition, the application allows users to retrieve and download previously converted 
audiobooks , offering a personalized library of accessible content. With the inclusion of various 
voice accents and languages , users can select the voice that best suits their prefer ences, 
improving the overall listening experience.  
 
This project aims to provide a seamless, user -friendly platform that enhances the independence 
of visually impaired individuals, enabling them to enjoy books and educational content without 
barr iers.
